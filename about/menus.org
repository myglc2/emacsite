* Menu Generation

Menus are generated by including the =header.org= file containing the
=menu= code block. The
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html][Emacs Lisp]]
=menu= code inserts the GitHub URL and adjusts the =href= for each
menu item. [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html][Doc]]
