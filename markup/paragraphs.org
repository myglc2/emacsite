* Paragraphs
#+INCLUDE: "./paragraphs-buttons.org"

Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line. If you need to
enforce a line break within a paragraph, use \\
at the end of the line.

To preserve the line breaks, indentation and blank lines in a region,
but otherwise use normal formatting, you can use a verse block:

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Great clouds overhead
Tiny black birds rise and fall
Snow covers Emacs

-- AlexSchroeder
#+END_VERSE
